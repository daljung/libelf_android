    or earlier, as these versions did not properly clean up after
    themselves in libelfg0-dev.prerm. This kludge will go away at some
    point.

libelf0 (0.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * compiled with -D_REENTRANT (for a more thread-safe library.)
  * added a postinst to run ldconfig (gotta love conflicting information
    from the programmer's manual :-)

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Mon, 3 Feb 1997 20:47:00 +1100

libelf0 (0.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * added dependancies for libc5/libc5-dev to libelf0/libelf0-dev (as per

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Wed, 18 Dec 1996 20:00:00 +1100

libelf0 (0.6.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * added Replaces/Conflicts to the control file for both packages.
    (wasn't in revision 1 for some reason...hmm.)

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Wed, 6 Nov 1996 18:31:00 +1100

libelf0 (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new source version
  * modified rules to reflect the changes in the upstream Makefile.
    (unfortunately, libelf needs to be compiled twice for the devel
    and shared libs, so it gets built in the binary-* rules. Anybody
    got any better ideas?)
  * libelf-dev no longer replaces any header files from libc, so the
    Replaces: field is removed. (doesn't seem to be in 0.5.2-3 for
    some reason...hmm.)

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Wed, 30 Oct 1996 20:13:19 +1100

libelf0 (0.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * renamed package to libelf0 (0 being the soname)
  * installed shlibs into debian/tmp-shared/DEBIAN/ - oops :-)
  * corrected shlibs to reflect the package name change
  * removed debian/control.{dev,shared} - finally figured out how multiple
    binary packages are meant to come from a single source package.
  * added Conflicts: and Replaces: libelf[-dev] to the appropriate section
    of the control file. Also Provides: libelf[-dev] (though I doubt any
    package actually uses libelf yet.)
  * corrected the libelf0-dev dependancy on libelf0. (I'm surprised that
    nobody picked up on this: it depended on - literally -
    libelf (= Source-Version).)

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Sun, 27 Oct 1996 17:48:42 +1000

libelf (0.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * converted to the 2.1.1.0 source format
  * stripped shared libraries (not development [static] libs, though.)
  * reformatted the changelog
  * added Replaces: libc5 to the libelf-dev package (it replaces a couple
    of .h files from libc). _PLEASE_ contact me if this is incorrect; it
    seems the right thing to do from the programmer's manual...
  * added a shlibs file to the debian directory
  * installed the Debian changelog.

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Sun, 22 Sep 1996 18:49:27 +1000
